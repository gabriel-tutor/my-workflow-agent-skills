# Plugin behavior tests

This file is the evidence for the `matt-pocock-workflow` v2 plugin. It follows §7 of the spec, `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-11-matt-pocock-workflow-plugin-design.md`.

All headless runs use `claude -p` (Claude Code 2.1.268, Opus 5) with the Superpowers plugin disabled through `--settings`. Nothing in `~/.claude/settings.json` is changed.

## Assumptions (spec §2), checked 2026-09-11

| # | Assumption | Result | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | A marketplace entry with `"source": "./plugin"` resolves. | Holds for validation. Installing through the marketplace is exercised at rollout. | `claude plugin validate .` and `claude plugin validate plugin` both pass. |
| 2 | `--plugin-dir` runs the plugin's SessionStart hook with `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` set. | Holds. | A probe plugin's hook ran with `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` set to the plugin directory. Its stream-json `hook_response` event appeared, and the model quoted the injected marker back. |
| 3 | SessionStart stdin carries `cwd`. | Holds. | The stdin fields were `session_id`, `transcript_path`, `cwd`, `hook_event_name` and `source`. The hook's process working directory equals `cwd`. |
| 4 | AskUserQuestion is available in headless runs. | Does not hold. | The tool is absent from the init event's tool list in three configurations: plain `-p`, `--input-format stream-json`, and `--allowedTools AskUserQuestion`. |

**What follows from assumption 4.** The spec's fallback applies. The grill presentation test checks for exactly one question in the text reply. Whether the grill uses AskUserQuestion itself is checked by manual acceptance at rollout.

## The plugin loads and injects (Task 1), 2026-09-11

A headless session was run from this repo with `--plugin-dir plugin` and Superpowers disabled.

- **Our SessionStart hook ran.** Its stream-json `hook_response` event shows exit 0 and outcome `success`, with 680 bytes injected (placeholder bootstrap). This event is the evidence that the hook ran; the plan asked for debug output, and this is equivalent.
- **The model quoted back all three lines:** the bootstrap marker, the MP-location line pointing at `~/.claude/skills`, and the repo-setup line (this repo has no `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`).
- **The init event lists the plugin** as `matt-pocock-workflow@inline` version 2.0.0, with these skills: `matt-pocock-workflow:using-matt-pocock-skills` and the four copied Superpowers skills (`using-git-worktrees`, `verification-before-completion`, `finishing-a-development-branch`, `receiving-code-review`). No `superpowers:` skills are visible.
- **Cost:** $0.21.

## Routing: bugs and trivial edits (Task 3), 2026-09-11

**The bootstrap at this point:**
- the rule: classify the request, then invoke its skill before the first action; a 1% chance is enough, and the heavier row wins
- one row for trivial edits and one for bugs
- a red-flags line
- the stage owners, with the Superpowers guard line
- three rules

The injection is 2,180 bytes.

**Method.** `scripts/behavior_test.py` runs each prompt 5 times per arm, each time in a fresh fixture workspace, with `--permission-mode acceptEdits` and Superpowers disabled. A run's verdict is its first committing call: a Skill or AskUserQuestion call, or an Edit or Write. The prompts are the benchmark's own, from `benchmark/scenarios/<name>/prompt.md`.

| Scenario | Control (no plugin) | Plugin |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `concurrency-bug` | Edit first, 5/5. Each run made one Bash call and 6–7 reads, then edited without writing any text first. | `diagnosing-bugs` first, 5/5. In every run it was the very first tool call. |
| `cosmetic-edit` | Edit first, 5/5, after one Bash call and two reads. | Edit first, 5/5, after one Bash call and two reads. No process skill ran. |

Both pass bars were met with the first wording, so no revisions were needed. Every record was read by hand: none timed out, and no run wrote text before its first committing call.
