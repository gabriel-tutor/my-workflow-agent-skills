# Plugin behavior tests

This file is the evidence for the `matt-pocock-workflow` v2 plugin. It follows §7 of the spec, `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-11-matt-pocock-workflow-plugin-design.md`.

All headless runs use `claude -p` (Claude Code 2.1.268, Opus 5) with the Superpowers plugin disabled through `--settings`. Nothing in `~/.claude/settings.json` is changed.

## Assumptions (spec §2), checked 2026-09-11

| # | Assumption | Result | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | A marketplace entry with `"source": "./plugin"` resolves. | Holds for validation. Installing through the marketplace is exercised at rollout. | `claude plugin validate .` and `claude plugin validate plugin` both pass. |
| 2 | `--plugin-dir` runs the plugin's SessionStart hook with `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` set. | Holds. | A probe plugin's hook ran with `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` set to the plugin directory. Its stream-json `hook_response` event appeared, and the model quoted the injected marker back. |
| 3 | SessionStart stdin carries `cwd`. | Holds. | The stdin fields were `session_id`, `transcript_path`, `cwd`, `hook_event_name` and `source`. The hook's process working directory equals `cwd`. |
| 4 | AskUserQuestion is available in headless runs. | Does not hold. | The tool is absent from the init event's tool list in three configurations: plain `-p`, `--input-format stream-json`, and `--allowedTools AskUserQuestion`. |

**What follows from assumption 4.** The spec's fallback applies. The grill presentation test checks for exactly one question in the text reply. Whether the grill uses AskUserQuestion itself is checked by manual acceptance at rollout.

**Read access to Matt Pocock's skill files (found during Task 4).** Headless runs deny reads outside the workspace. The entries in `~/.claude/skills/<name>` are symlinks into `~/.skills-manager/skills/`, and the permission check uses the resolved path. Three probe runs, 2026-09-11:

| Allow rule | Reading `~/.claude/skills/to-spec/SKILL.md` |
| --- | --- |
| none | denied |
| `Read(~/.claude/skills/**)` | denied |
| `Read(~/.claude/skills/**)` and `Read(~/.skills-manager/**)` | allowed |

What follows from this:

- The grill loads `grilling` through the Skill tool rather than reading its file.
- The pointer skills must read user-only files, so they need an allow rule for the resolved directory.
- The rollout adds that rule with the user's approval.
- The behavior tests pass the same rule through `--settings`.

## The plugin loads and injects (Task 1), 2026-09-11

A headless session was run from this repo with `--plugin-dir plugin` and Superpowers disabled.

- **Our SessionStart hook ran.** Its stream-json `hook_response` event shows exit 0 and outcome `success`, with 680 bytes injected (placeholder bootstrap). This event is the evidence that the hook ran; the plan asked for debug output, and this is equivalent.
- **The model quoted back all three lines:** the bootstrap marker, the MP-location line pointing at `~/.claude/skills`, and the repo-setup line (this repo has no `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`).
- **The init event lists the plugin** as `matt-pocock-workflow@inline` version 2.0.0, with these skills: `matt-pocock-workflow:using-matt-pocock-skills` and the four copied Superpowers skills (`using-git-worktrees`, `verification-before-completion`, `finishing-a-development-branch`, `receiving-code-review`). No `superpowers:` skills are visible.
- **Cost:** $0.21.

## Routing: bugs and trivial edits (Task 3), 2026-09-11

**The bootstrap at this point:**
- the rule: classify the request, then invoke its skill before the first action; a 1% chance is enough, and the heavier row wins
- one row for trivial edits and one for bugs
- a red-flags line
- the stage owners, with the Superpowers guard line
- three rules

The injection is 2,180 bytes.

**Method.** `scripts/behavior_test.py` runs each prompt 5 times per arm, each time in a fresh fixture workspace, with `--permission-mode acceptEdits` and Superpowers disabled. A run's verdict is its first committing call: a Skill or AskUserQuestion call, or an Edit or Write. The prompts are the benchmark's own, from `benchmark/scenarios/<name>/prompt.md`.

| Scenario | Control (no plugin) | Plugin |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `concurrency-bug` | Edit first, 5/5. Each run made one Bash call and 6–7 reads, then edited without writing any text first. | `diagnosing-bugs` first, 5/5. In every run it was the very first tool call. |
| `cosmetic-edit` | Edit first, 5/5, after one Bash call and two reads. | Edit first, 5/5, after one Bash call and two reads. No process skill ran. |

Both pass bars were met with the first wording, so no revisions were needed. Every record was read by hand: none timed out, and no run wrote text before its first committing call.

## Routing and the interactive grill (Task 4), 2026-09-11

**Bootstrap changes:**
- A row for a bounded change: `grill` (short), then `tdd`.
- A row for new behavior that fits one session: `grill` plus `domain-modeling`, then `implement`.
- A new red flag: "the requirements are already clear".
- Rules for one question per turn and for settling test seams in the grill.
- The Superpowers guard line was shortened.

The injection is 2,388 bytes.

**Routing.** The table shows each run's first committing call, in default mode.

| Prompt | Control (no plugin) | Plugin |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `small-behavior-change` (coupons) | Edit first, 5/5 | `matt-pocock-workflow:grill` first, 5/5, as the very first tool call |
| Gift cards: "Add gift card support to OrderKit: customers should be able to pay part of an order with a gift card balance." | Write first, 5/5, after about 100 seconds of exploring, without asking any question | `matt-pocock-workflow:grill` first, 5/5, as the very first tool call |

Two plugin runs stated their classification before invoking the grill: "a bounded change to existing code" and "new behavior that should fit in one session".

**Presentation.** These runs used `--past-skill`: each run continues through skill calls and ends at the grill's first reply. AskUserQuestion is unavailable in headless runs, so the question arrives as text. Every reply was read by hand. A run passes when its reply poses exactly one question.

| Wording | Coupons | Gift cards | What happened |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| v1: read grilling's file, one question per turn | 5/5 | 4/5 | Gift-card run 5 listed all eight open questions before asking the first. Several runs couldn't read grilling's file (see the permission finding above) and worked from the grill's summary instead. |
| v2: load `grilling` through the Skill tool; each turn is exactly facts plus one question | 3/5 | 5/5 | Coupon run 2 listed five upcoming questions. Coupon run 5 previewed the next question as a question. |
| v3: the facts may state how many decisions remain, as a number | 5/5 | 5/5 | Progress showed as a count ("5 more decisions after this one"). Three gift-card runs added topic names to the count, without question marks. |

Every v3 run invoked `grill`, then `grilling`, then `domain-modeling`. Every reply ended with a single decision, with the recommended option first.

**For manual acceptance.** Gift-card v3 run 2 treated "a gift card is a payment" as a settled fact and opened with the next decision (who owns the balance), rather than asking about it.
